# UdacityDataScienceProject4- Dog Breed Classification Algorithm

## Description
This is the repository for my Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Project 4 about a dog classification algorithm. The algorithm takes in a photo and first determines if it's a dog, a human, or something else. If it is a dog, it returns the predicted dog breed. If the photo is of a human it returns the dog breed that the human most closely resembles. If the picture is not detected as either a dog or a human, an error is shown. This algorithm works best when a headshot of a human is used, and if a full body human picture is used an error may be produced.
